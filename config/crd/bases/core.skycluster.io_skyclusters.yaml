                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

                                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
